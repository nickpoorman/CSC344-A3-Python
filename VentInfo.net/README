# VentInfo.net - A social ventrilo comment website
##################################################

Just as a note I have never done any web development before this so learning everything about
	python, mod_pyton, regex, cgi, html, javascript, jquery, cron, sqlite3, and proper apache 
	permissions all had to be learned to complete this project. I also had to figure out 
	how to get the python scripts to interact with the proprietary, closed source Ventrilo protocol.

About:
VentInfo.net grabs the comments from the popular online voice chatting software Ventrilo
	and persists them to a databse. The webiste provides a social networking aspect to
	other users comments.

Future plans:
	Registered users will have the ability to tether their
		Ventrilo server account with their VentInfo.net account.

	Each user will have the ablility to delete their own comments from the site.

	Users will be able to add their own private Ventrilo servers to be monitored
		by the website.

	Users will be able to change their avatar of thier profile on the site. Or
		link to their gravatar account. 

	Each user will have the ability to comment on other users Ventrilo comments.

	The index page will be redone to use proper web design patterns, such as divs
		for the layout instead of a table with CSS.
