ventrilo_status - the program that created the UDP packet to ping the server for its status information

get-comments.py - the python script that parses the info and persists it to the sqlite database
	*Note: Be sure to change the rootdir for the comments.db in the script

logs - the file that any errors get logged to

comments.db - the sqlite3 database file that holds all our information
	*Note: Make sure that the path to the comments.db is readable 
	 	and writable by the webserver as well as the user running
		the get-comments.py script.

To have the script run every minute on the server add the following to your crontab:

	* * * * * <PATH TO get-comments.py> >> <PATH TO logs> 2>&1

	ex:
	* * * * * /home/nick/csc344/ventcomments/get-comments.py >> /home/nick/csc344/ventcomments/logs 2>&1
